# Surface-Wave Waveform Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Collaborated with researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and other institutions to automatically classify seismic observations using a labeled dataset of around 400,000 records. In order to achieve it, the logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and artificial neural network algorithms were developed. Among all the models, the artificial neural network outperform other algorithms and achieved an accuracy of over 92%.

The results were presented at 2019 Seismological Society of America Annual meeting. Refer to poster to obtain the detailed information.
